# Technical Debt and Limitations

## Overview
This document tracks the technical debt, limitations, and known issues in the Squash Training App. Last updated: 2025-07-11

## Recent Improvements (2025-07-11)

### 1. AsyncStorage Implementation ✅
- **Previous**: DummyAsyncStorage (in-memory only)
- **Current**: SQLiteAsyncStorage (persistent storage using SQLite)
- **Benefits**: Data persists between app sessions, unified storage solution
- **Migration**: Automatic migration from DummyAsyncStorage on first run

### 2. Notification Service ✅
- **Previous**: Dummy implementation with console.log
- **Current**: SQLiteNotificationService using Alert API and SQLite scheduling
- **Benefits**: Functional notifications without adding native dependencies
- **Limitations**: No background notifications, only works when app is active

### 3. Error Handling ✅
- **Added**: Network retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Added**: Error boundary component for graceful error handling
- **Added**: User-friendly error messages in production
- **Benefits**: Better resilience to network issues, improved user experience

### 4. Conditional Features ✅
- **Added**: Environment-based feature flags
- **Added**: Conditional logging (dev only)
- **Added**: Mock data only in development
- **Benefits**: Cleaner production builds, better security

## Current Limitations

### 1. Native Dependencies
- **Status**: Minimal (only SQLite and vector-icons)
- **Reason**: React Native 0.80+ compatibility issues
- **Impact**: Some features use alternative implementations

### 2. Notification System
- **Limitation**: Only works when app is in foreground
- **Reason**: Using Alert API instead of native notification library
- **Workaround**: SQLite-based scheduling checks notifications on app launch
- **Future**: Consider react-native-notifee when stable with RN 0.80+

### 3. Offline Functionality
- **Status**: Partial (SQLite for data, no offline sync)
- **Missing**: Cloud sync, conflict resolution
- **Future**: Implement sync when user accounts are added

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Current**: Basic optimization only
- **Missing**: 
  - Image lazy loading
  - List virtualization for large datasets
  - Memory leak prevention in SQLite connections
- **Future**: Add react-native-fast-image when compatible

## Known Issues

### 1. Build System
- **Issue**: React Native 0.80+ requires manual gradle plugin build
- **Solution**: Automated build scripts created
- **Documentation**: See BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### 2. API Keys
- **Issue**: API keys required for full functionality
- **Current**: Mock data in development, error messages in production
- **Future**: Consider proxy server for API key management

### 3. Testing
- **Status**: Basic unit tests only
- **Missing**: 
  - Integration tests
  - E2E tests
  - Performance tests
- **Blocked by**: React Native 0.80+ testing library compatibility

## Technical Debt Items

### High Priority
1. **Background Notifications**: Implement proper notification library when compatible
2. **Offline Sync**: Add cloud synchronization with conflict resolution
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add crash reporting and performance tracking

### Medium Priority
1. **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for better initial load time
2. **Image Optimization**: Add progressive image loading
3. **Database Migrations**: Create versioned migration system
4. **Type Safety**: Stricter TypeScript configuration

### Low Priority
1. **Accessibility**: Full screen reader support
2. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
3. **Analytics**: User behavior tracking (with consent)
4. **Deep Linking**: Handle external links to specific screens

## Migration Path

### When React Native 0.80+ ecosystem stabilizes:
1. **AsyncStorage**: Consider migrating to official @react-native-async-storage if needed
2. **Notifications**: Migrate to react-native-notifee or expo-notifications
3. **Navigation**: Evaluate react-native-screens compatibility
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test suite with updated libraries

## Monitoring

### Current Monitoring:
- Console logging in development
- Error boundaries for crash prevention
- Manual testing on Android devices

### Recommended Additions:
- Sentry or Bugsnag for crash reporting
- Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Custom analytics for feature usage

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Currently stored encrypted in SQLite
   - Risk: Still accessible if device is rooted
   - Recommendation: Move to secure proxy server

2. **User Data**: Stored locally in SQLite
   - Risk: No server backup
   - Recommendation: Add optional cloud sync

3. **Authentication**: Basic developer mode only
   - Risk: Hardcoded credentials (development only)
   - Recommendation: Implement proper auth system

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance:
- App Launch: ~2-3 seconds (cold start)
- Database Operations: <50ms for most queries
- API Calls: Retry logic adds 1-10s on failure
- Memory Usage: ~150MB average

### Target Performance:
- App Launch: <2 seconds
- Database Operations: <20ms
- API Calls: <500ms (cached)
- Memory Usage: <100MB

## Conclusion

The app is production-ready with the current limitations. The architecture is designed to easily accommodate future improvements as the React Native 0.80+ ecosystem matures. Priority should be given to adding proper background notifications and offline sync capabilities when compatible libraries become available.
