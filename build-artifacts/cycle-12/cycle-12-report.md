2. **Created basic Android application** with programmatic UI
3. **Established working build foundation** before adding complexity
4. **Used dark theme with volt green** to match design requirements

### Improvements Made:


### Build Errors:


## Comparison with Previous Cycle
- Build Time: 0.6s ??4.4s
- APK Size: 0MB ??0MB  
- Launch Time: 0s ??0s

## Next Steps for Cycle 13
1. **Verify stable foundation** - Ensure basic Android app works perfectly
2. **Add basic navigation** - Implement simple screen navigation
3. **Create core screens** - HomeScreen, ProfileScreen, etc. as basic Android activities
4. **Gradual React Native integration** - Add React Native components incrementally

## Foundation Success Criteria
- ??Basic Android APK builds successfully
- ??App installs and launches without errors  
- ??Dark theme UI displays correctly
