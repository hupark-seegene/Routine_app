**Version**: 1.0.8 (Code: 9)
**Previous Version**: 1.0.7 (Code: 8)

## ?렞 Key Focus: NPM Setup & First Screen

### Building on Previous Success
React Native framework is integrated. Now implementing:
- NPM dependency installation
- First app screen (HomeScreen)
- Dark theme with volt green (#C9FF00)
- Actual React Native UI rendering

### Goals for This Cycle
1. Install npm dependencies
2. Create HomeScreen component
3. Implement dark theme
4. Update App.js with real UI
5. Verify React components render

### Expected Outcomes
- Larger APK size (with React Native libraries)
- Visible React Native UI
- Dark theme with volt accents
- Metro bundler integration

## Analysis

### UI Development Progress:
?좑툘 **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: UI components created but not fully rendering
- Theme system in place
- HomeScreen component ready
- May need Metro bundler running
- Check screenshot for actual UI

### APK Size Analysis:
??Minimal size change
- React Native may not be fully bundled
- Check npm installation and bundle creation

### Cycle 9 Strategy: Navigation & Multiple Screens

#### Primary Goals:
1. Implement React Navigation
2. Create additional screens (ChecklistScreen, RecordScreen)
3. Add bottom tab navigation
4. Connect screens with navigation

#### Technical Tasks:
