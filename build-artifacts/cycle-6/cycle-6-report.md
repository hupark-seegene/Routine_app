# Cycle 6 Report
**Date**: 2025-07-13 01:04:34
**Version**: 1.0.6 (Code: 7)
**Previous Version**: 1.0.5 (Code: 6)

## ?렞 Key Focus: React Native Plugin Integration

### React Native Integration Phase Begins!
This is the first cycle of the intensive React Native integration phase (Cycles 6-20).

### Goals for This Cycle
1. Apply React Native gradle plugin
2. Configure basic React Native settings
3. Create index.js entry point
4. Update MainActivity for React
5. Test basic React Native functionality

### Risk Level: HIGH
This cycle attempts significant changes that may cause build failures.
SafeMode is enabled for automatic rollback if needed.

## React Native Integration Progress
- **Plugin Status**: Applied
- **RN Integration**: Plugin Active
- **React Files Created**: index.js, App.js
- **Build Errors**: None

## Cycle 6 Achievements:
- Created React Native entry files
- Updated MainActivity for React Native
- Applied React Native gradle plugin


## Analysis

### Current Challenges:
1. React Native 0.80+ gradle plugin system incompatibility
2. Plugin registration mechanism changed
3. Need alternative integration approach

### Expected Issues (RN 0.80+):
- Plugin "com.facebook.react" not found is EXPECTED
- This is due to the new plugin system in React Native 0.80+
- Requires either:
  a) Pre-building the gradle plugin
  b) Using React Native CLI commands
  c) Alternative integration methods

### Cycle 7 Strategy: Alternative Integration

#### Approach Options:
1. **Option A**: Use React Native CLI for builds
   - Let npx react-native handle plugin registration
   - Focus on app code rather than gradle configuration
   
2. **Option B**: Manual integration without plugin
   - Add React Native as standard dependencies
   - Create custom gradle tasks for bundling
   - Direct integration approach

3. **Option C**: Hybrid PowerShell + CLI approach
   - Use React Native CLI for complex operations
   - PowerShell for automation and testing
   - Best of both worlds

#### Recommended Next Steps (Cycle 7):
1. Try React Native CLI build approach
2. If successful, wrap CLI commands in PowerShell
3. Focus on getting React components rendering
4. Establish working build pipeline

### Success Criteria for Cycle 7:
- Find working build method (CLI or manual)
- React Native components rendering
- Hot reload functional
- Basic navigation setup

### Cycles 8-20 Roadmap:
- Cycle 8: Navigation setup
- Cycle 9: First app screen
- Cycle 10: SQLite integration
- Cycles 11-15: Core screens implementation
- Cycles 16-20: Polish and optimization
