# Cycle 4 Report
**Date**: 2025-07-13 00:56:34
**Version**: 1.0.4 (Code: 5)
**Previous Version**: 1.0.3 (Code: 4)

## ?렞 Key Focus: React Native Core Dependencies

### Critical Phase Alert
This cycle attempts to add React Native dependencies which may cause build failures.
SafeMode is enabled for automatic rollback if needed.

### Improvements from Cycle 3
- Adding React Native core dependencies
- Implementing dependency conflict resolution
- Enhanced rollback mechanisms
- Progressive dependency addition

## Analysis

### Current Challenges:
1. React Native 0.80+ plugin system incompatibility
2. Dependency resolution without proper plugin
3. Manual integration complexity

### Cycle 5 Strategy: Foundation Completion

#### Approach Options:
1. **Option A**: Continue minimal dependencies approach
   - Add React Native JARs/AARs manually
   - Skip gradle plugin entirely
   - Focus on basic functionality

2. **Option B**: Custom gradle configuration
   - Create custom tasks for JS bundling
   - Manual dependency management
   - Direct AAR inclusion

3. **Option C**: Hybrid approach
   - Use React Native CLI for bundle creation
   - Manual APK assembly
   - Progressive feature addition

#### Recommended Next Steps (Cycle 5):
1. Complete foundation scripts (automation tools)
2. Create dependency resolution helper
3. Implement JS bundle creation separately
4. Test basic React component rendering

### Success Criteria for Cycle 5:
- Foundation automation complete
- Clear path forward for RN integration
- All helper scripts functional
- Ready for intensive RN work (Cycles 6-20)
[00:56:45] [Success] Enhancement analysis complete
