## Enhancements for Next Cycle

Based on Cycle 1 results:

1. **Current State**: Basic Android app showing "Build Test" text
2. **Next Goal**: Begin React Native dependency restoration

### Recommended Changes for Cycle 2:
- Add React Native repository configuration
- Include React Native core dependencies
- Prepare MainActivity for React integration
- Add Metro bundler connection setup

### Metrics to Track:

- APK size: Monitor growth as dependencies added
- Stability: Currently stable (no crashes)

### Success Criteria for Cycle 2:
- Build completes without errors
- APK size increases (indicating dependencies included)
- App still launches without crashes
