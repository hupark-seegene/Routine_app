## ?렞 Key Focus: React Native Component Rendering

### Building on Cycle 6 Success
The React Native plugin was successfully applied. Now focusing on:
- Creating proper JS bundle
- Setting up Metro bundler
- Getting React components to render
- Testing React Native UI

### Goals for This Cycle
1. Create MainApplication.java for React Native
2. Generate JavaScript bundle
3. Configure Metro bundler
4. Test React component rendering
5. Verify hot reload capability

## React Native Component Status
- **Bundle Created**: True
- **Metro Bundler**: Not Started
- **RN Integration**: Component Rendering
- **React Rendering**: False
- **Build Errors**: None

## Cycle 7 Achievements:
- Created MainApplication for React Native
- Created JavaScript bundle


## Analysis

### Progress Assessment:
?좑툘 **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: React Native framework active but components not yet visible
- Plugin integration successful
- Framework initializing
- Need proper npm setup for full rendering

### Size Analysis:
- APK size unchanged
- React Native libraries may not be fully included
- Need to verify dependency inclusion

### Next Steps Required:
1. **NPM Setup** (if not rendering):
   - Run npm install in project directory
   - Install React Native dependencies
   - Regenerate bundle with Metro

2. **UI Development**:
   - Implement actual Squash Training UI
   - Add navigation
   - Style components

### Cycle 8 Strategy: NPM Setup & First Screen

#### Primary Goals:
1. Ensure npm dependencies are installed
2. Create first real app screen
3. Add navigation structure
4. Implement dark theme

#### Technical Tasks:
- Run npm install process
- Create HomeScreen component
- Setup React Navigation
- Apply volt green theme

### Success Criteria for Cycle 8:
- All npm dependencies installed
- Metro bundler running
- First screen visible
- Navigation working

### Remaining Cycles Plan (8-20):
- Cycles 8-10: Core screens and navigation
- Cycles 11-13: Database integration
- Cycles 14-16: AI Coach implementation
- Cycles 17-19: Polish and optimization
- Cycle 20: Feature complete

## Component Rendering Phase Progress
Phase Status: ?봽 IN PROGRESS - Framework active, needs npm setup
[01:08:47] [Success] Component rendering analysis complete
[01:08:47] [Info] Report saved to: C:\Git\Routine_app\build-artifacts\cycle-7\cycle-7-report.md
[01:08:47] [React] RN Status: Component Rendering
[01:08:47] [React] Components Rendering: False
[01:08:47] [Info] Next: NPM setup and first screen implementation
