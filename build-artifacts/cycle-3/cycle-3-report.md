## Metrics Comparison (Cycle 3 vs Cycle 2)

| Metric | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Build Time | s | 0.8s | -1.9s |
| APK Size | MB | 5.34MB | 0MB |
| Launch Time | s | 3.1s | 0s |
| Memory | N/A | 0.0MB | New |

## React Native Integration Status
- **Current Status**: Build Success with RN
- **Repositories**: Enabled in both root and app build.gradle
- **Build Errors**: None

## Improvements Applied:
- Enabled React Native repositories in app build.gradle


## Enhancements for Next Cycle (Cycle 4)

### Immediate Goals:
1. Add React Native core dependencies
2. Configure Metro bundler support
3. Update MainActivity for React integration

### Technical Tasks:
- Add implementation("com.facebook.react:react-native:+")
- Configure JS bundle creation
- Add React Native initialization code

### Risk Assessment:
- **High Risk**: Dependency conflicts with React Native 0.80+
- **Mitigation**: Incremental addition with fallback options

### Success Criteria for Cycle 4:
- React Native dependencies successfully added
- Build completes (even if app doesn't fully work)
- APK size increases significantly (RN libraries)
- Basic error handling for RN initialization
[00:53:39] [Success] Enhancement analysis complete
