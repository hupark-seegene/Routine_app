## Metrics Comparison

### Cycle 2 vs Cycle 1:
- **APK Size**: 5.34MB (0MB, 0%)
- **Build Time**: 2.7s
- **Install Time**: 0.2s (NEW)
- **Launch Time**: 3.1s (NEW)
- **Memory Usage**: 0.0MB (NEW)

## Improvements Applied:
- Started React Native integration preparation
- Added RN repository configuration


## Enhancements for Next Cycle

Based on Cycle 2 results:

1. **Current State**: Basic Android app with improved build process
2. **Next Goal**: Add React Native maven repository

### Recommended Changes for Cycle 3:
- Enable React Native maven repository
- Add React Native AAR dependencies
- Prepare for Metro bundler integration
- Add error recovery mechanisms

### Success Criteria for Cycle 3:
- Successful integration of React Native repositories
- Build completes without dependency errors
- APK size increases (RN dependencies)
- App remains stable

### Risk Mitigation:
- Keep fallback to basic Android if RN fails
- Incremental dependency addition
- Comprehensive error logging
